How to use:

%temprun <quest> <url> <params>

Quest can be the id of the quest or a nicknam, use %nickq <questId> nickname to add a q

Url is the link of the run, you can surround the link with <> to avoid the embed in the chat.
While the system tries to avoid storing duplicate links, please be try to avoid sending already
existing runs.

Params is the bulk of the commands, you are building the party of the submission. All data here is
to then be able to filter runs with certain attributes. For example, searching for runs where the
main dps is x servant.
Building the party starts by entering 'svt<servantId or nickname>', this means that the leftmost
servant in the party is that servant. 
Following svt, you can enter different arguments to modify that servant
'l100' to set their level to 100, defaults to their base max lvl
'fou2000' to set their fou to 2000, defaults to 1000
'main' sets this servant as the main dps
'b' sets this servant as the borrowed servant
The servant is acompagnied by a craft essence
